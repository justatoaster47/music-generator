# music-generator
A simple javascript/html/css project to generate and play melodies with tone.js.

Eventually hoping to improve the interface for reliability and add more detail to melody-generator's formula.

Simply use localhost to use. It is definitely error prone, but the idea is good in concept. Any ideas for improvement welcome.
